A new list is created once when the function is defined, and the same list is used in each successive call.

Pythonâ€™s default arguments are evaluated once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called (like it is in say, Ruby). This means that if you use a mutable
default argument and mutate it, you will and have mutated that object for all future calls to the function as well.
